# Dual Universe Items and Group 

I will try to keep this list up to date.

Initial data was taken from hyperion item export. But i only took those keys that i need and because those data was incomplete with some NQIds i started my own.

If you see any mistakes, typos or just missing data just create an issue or start a pull request.

## TODOs

- add missing athena items
- create npm package
- add little script to validate unique ids on push/pull request
- fix honeycomb NQIds
- add recipe ids
- get icon files to upload on own server
- add relevant missing values like width, height, depth, etc
